The site is designed for an admin to curate content (offers for homeless people) on a public facing web page by incorporating content emailed to him or her off-site. 

It is coded with a Vue.js front end and a Python back end.

The site enables helpers for the homeless to navigate content of private offerings and learn via video how to use public services. 

Patrons may view featured offers, display all offers, navigate linearly between offers, search offers, and utilize tags to find types of content. 

The Admin may use the array of CRUD functions to curate content.

The design is admin-centric because we need to take steps verifying that people are who and what they say they are so that the general public does not take offers away from homeless people they could potentially use as well.
